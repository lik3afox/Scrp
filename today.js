Room.Memory holds all the labs stuff
when a creep gets put into the query - it will check the room and see if there's mats for it.
if there is, it will do a hold on those mats. - the request will be through labs - so if there's not enough for X work it won't do it. 

- Used by powerbank killers and also 
- used by miners.
- soon used by everything.

Start putting things in memory - you can change it in memory pretty easily, sense you don't do any modifications to it within the program it self.
	- Labs
	- Spawns
	- Expansions
	- Terminal info
	- Anything done to customize

- Start using segiments - So only 10 get updated, so every tick up date 10 ones keep track of it. 
- Change console to important things only - Bucket and stuff
